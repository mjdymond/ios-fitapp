**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add weight entry form (date picker, weight input)
- [ ] Implement weight history list view
- [ ] Enhance chart with time period filters (week/month/year)
- [ ] Add weight goal tracking and progress indicators
- [ ] Integrate with HealthKit to sync weight data

**Files to Work On**:
- Enhance `FitApp/Features/Weight/WeightView.swift`
- Add `WeightEntryFormView.swift`, `WeightHistoryView.swift`

---

## 🚀 **Medium-Term Development Goals**

- [ ] Add workout timer and rest periods
- [ ] Track sets, reps, and weights
- [ ] Workout history and progress tracking
- [ ] Pre-built workout templates

### **5. Meal Planning & Nutrition (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Status**: Basic structure only
**Goal**: Complete nutrition tracking and meal planning

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Food database integration (or manual food entry)
- [ ] Calorie and macro tracking
- [ ] Meal planning with recipes
- [ ] Barcode scanning for easy food entry
- [ ] Daily nutrition goals and progress

### **6. HealthKit Integration (LOW PRIORITY)**
**Status**: Service structure ready
**Goal**: Sync with Apple Health app

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement HealthKit data reading (weight, workouts, nutrition)
- [ ] Add HealthKit data writing capabilities
- [ ] Background sync functionality
- [ ] User preference settings for what to sync

## 💡 **Recommended Development Approach**

1. **Start with Authentication**: Get user onboarding working first
2. **Build Incrementally**: Complete one feature fully before moving to the next
3. **Test Early**: Build and test frequently on device/simulator
4. **Follow iOS Patterns**: Use native iOS design patterns and components
5. **Document Changes**: Update this file as you complete tasks

---

## 🤝 **Communication & Handoff**

### **Current State Summary**
- **✅ Project Status**: Builds successfully, installs on simulator
- **✅ Git Status**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- **✅ Dependencies**: No external dependencies, uses only native iOS frameworks
- **⚠️ Next Priority**: User authentication and onboarding flow

### **Questions for Product Owner/Stakeholder**
- What authentication method is preferred? (Apple Sign-In, email, or guest mode?)
- Should the app work offline-first or require internet connection?
- What are the target demographics and use cases?
- Are there any specific health/fitness API integrations required?

---

## 📝 **Notes for Next Developer**

- The current codebase is clean and well-structured for expansion
- All Core Data models are complete and ready for use
- Custom weight charts work well - consider reusing this pattern for other charts
- The tab navigation structure is solid and shouldn't need changes
- Focus on user experience - this should feel like a native iOS app
- Consider adding @StateObject and @EnvironmentObject for better state management as the app grows
